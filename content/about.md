# About me

I'm a Lead Software Engineer, Product Owner, and Cloud + Technical Architect. I currently lead the Cloud Analytic Data Strategy group at a Fortune 50 company. Problem solver both at heart and by choice.

# My passion
I like using technologies to solve business problems, as well as developing and leading software engineering teams. When I am not doing that, I write `How-to` tutorials, and dabble around with different AWS Services.
